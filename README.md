## Solution 1:
Solution 1 implements two methods, stack and queue, to perform add and remove operations on a list as illustrated in the problem.

## Solution 2:
Solution 2 takes the name of the CSV file to load data from in the dataframe. User can use the `count_vowels_in_csv('titles.csv', 'title')` function to specify the name of the csv and the columnName in which the user wants to count the vowels. The function also writes another file “output.csv” with a new column that stores the count of vowels in the specified column. For quick testing “titles.csv” is present in the git repo which can be used to directly run the function.

## Solution 3:
`streamlit run Question_3.py` command runs a streamlit app that lets user upload a csv file with “Name” and “Age” columns and plots a Histogram out of them.
